Description:
This is a really accessible and well validated contact form powered by PHP and jQuery. The design is based on Orman Clark’s ‘Clean and Simple Signup Form‘.

Using both serverside PHP and client-side input validation (powered by Jorn Zaefferer’s great jQuery Validation Plugin) this form is developed using ARIA accessibility standards, making it one of the most accessible and reliable contact forms available.
